# BitBlit API - 2D Graphics Library

## Description
BitBlit API is a powerful, easy-to-use 2D graphics library written in C++ designed for creating and manipulating various graphical elements like shapes, paths, and textures. It allows users to draw complex shapes such as parallelograms, circles, curves, and convex polygons, and apply various visual effects using shaders.

## Key Features
- **Shape Drawing**: Support for drawing various shapes including circles, parallelograms, and convex polygons.
- **Coloring and Texturing**: Implements shaders that allow objects to be colored using single colors, gradients, or textures from PNGs.
- **Transformations**: Utilizes linear algebra to support transformations such as scaling, translation, rotation, and stretching.
- **Blend Modes**: Includes 12 different blend modes for pixel blending to create various visual effects.
- **Tiling Modes**: Supports multiple tiling modes like repeating, clamping, and mirroring to enhance texture mapping.

## Acknowledgements
This project was initially started as an assigment for CS345 â€“ Graphics Software Architecture at Duke University. [Dr. Mike Reed](https://cs.unc.edu/person/mike-reed/) taught the course and provided the code found in the `apps` and `include` files. 

<!-- ## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. This library is built and tested primarily on GCC and Clang.

### Installation
Clone the repository and build the project using CMake:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GraphicsAPI.git
cd GraphicsAPI
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -->
